/**
 * Class that allows to flexibly manage what to do with a reported
 * warning/error.
 *
 * Guard has several choices:
 *   - return OFF - suppress the warning/error
 *   - return WARNING
 *   - return ERROR report it with high severity
 *   - return null. Does not know what to do with it. Lets the other guard
 *       decide what to do with it.
 *
 * Although the interface is very simple, it allows you easily customize what
 * warnings you are interested in.
 *
 * For example there are could be several implementations:
 *   StrictGuard - {return ERROR}. All warnings should be treat as errors.
 *   SilentGuard - {if (WARNING) return OFF}. Suppress all warnings but still
 *     fail if JS has errors.
 *   WhitelistGuard (if !whitelistErrors.contains(error) return ERROR) return
 *     error if it does not present in the whitelist.
