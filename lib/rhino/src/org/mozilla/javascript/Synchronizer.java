/**
 * This class provides support for implementing Java-style synchronized
 * methods in Javascript.
 *
 * Synchronized functions are created from ordinary Javascript
 * functions by the <code>Synchronizer</code> constructor, e.g.
 * <code>new Packages.org.mozilla.javascript.Synchronizer(fun)</code>.
 * The resulting object is a function that establishes an exclusive
 * lock on the <code>this</code> object of its invocation.
 *
 * The Rhino shell provides a short-cut for the creation of
 * synchronized methods: <code>sync(fun)</code> has the same effect as
 * calling the above constructor.
