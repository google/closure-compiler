/**
 * An AST traverser that keeps track of whether access to a generic resource are "guarded" or not. A
 * guarded use is one that will not cause runtime errors if the resource does not exist. The
 * resource (type {@code T} in the signature) is any value type computable from a node, such as a
 * qualified name or property name. It is up to the subclass to map the currently visited token to
 * the {@code T} in order to call {@link #isGuarded}, which depends entirely on the context from
 * ancestor nodes and previous calls to {@code #isGuarded} for the same resource.
 *
 * <p>More precisely, a resource may be guarded either <i>intrinsically</i> or <i>conditionally</i>,
 * as follows. A use is intrinsically guarded if it occurs in a context where its specific value is
 * immediately discarded, such as coercion to boolean or string. A use is conditionally guarded if
 * it occurs in a context conditioned on an intrinsically guarded use (such as the "then" or "else"
 * block of an "if", the second or third argument of a ternary operator, right-hand arguments of
 * logical operators, or later in a block in which an unconditional "throw" or "return" was found in
 * a guarded context).
 *
 * <p>For example, the following are all intrinsically guarded uses of {@code x}:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Coerced to boolean:
 * if (x);
 * x ? y : z;
 * x &amp;&amp; y;
 * Boolean(x);
 * !x;
 * x == y; x != y; x === y; x !== y;
 * x instanceof Foo;
 * typeof x === 'string';
 *
 * // Coerced to string:
 * String(x);
 * typeof x;
 *
 * // Immediately discarded (but doesn't make much sense in my contexts):
 * x = y;
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>The following uses of {@code x} are conditionally guarded:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * if (x) x();
 * !x ? null : x;
 * typeof x == 'function' ? x : () => {};
 * x &amp;&amp; x.y;
 * !x || x.y;
 * if (!x) return; x();
 * x ?? x = 3;
 * }</pre>
 *
 * Note that there is no logic to determine <i>which</i> branch is guarded, so any usages in either
 * branch will pass after such a check. As such, the following are also considered guarded, though a
 * human can easily see that this is spurious:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * if (!x) x();
 * if (x) { } else x();
 * !x &amp;&amp; x();
 * var y = x != null ? null : x;
 * }</pre>
 *
 * Note also that the call or property access is not necessary to make a use unguarded: the final
 * example immediately above would be unguarded if it weren't for the {@code x != null} condition,
 * since it allows the value of {@code x} to leak out in an uncontrolled way.
 *
 * <p>This class overrides the {@link Callback} API methods with final methods of its own, and
 * defines the template method {@link #visitGuarded} to perform the normal work for individual
 * nodes. The only other API is {@link #isGuarded}, which allows checking if a {@code T} in the
 * current node's context is guarded, either intrinsically or conditionally. If it is intrinsically
 * guarded, then it may be recorded as a condition for the purpose of guarding future contexts.
